Welcome to Somnolent... a game about dreams and memories :)
It follows a doctor on their journey in the Dreamscape... the doctor is helping a patient regain their memories by collecting memory fragments in the dream.
In the dream, the doctor meets multiple characters and has to pass some trials in order to collect the fragments and restore the patients missing memories ...

Press play in TitleScreen to begin playing! There is a book on the top right with some instructions in case you get lost... 

BTW we drew everything (minus some bgs) and it was SO FUN... ;)
